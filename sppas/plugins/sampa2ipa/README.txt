brief:      SPPAS plugin to convert SAMPA into IPA phonemes encoding.

This plugin allows to convert transcriptions between the SAMPA (Speech
Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet) annotation and the International
Phonetic Alphabet.

It can convert either individual time-aligned phonemes or time-aligned
strings of phonemes like syllables. The converted transcription is saved
in a new file. Any symbol in the transcription tier which is not in the
conversion file is not replaced.

In case of TextGrid files, it converts into the Praat version of the IPA.
