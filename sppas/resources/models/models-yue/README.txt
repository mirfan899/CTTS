This is a monophone Cantonese acoustic model, based on Jyutping of the 
Linguistic Society of Hong Kong  (LSHK). Each state is trained with 32 
Gaussian mixtures. The model is trained with HTK 3.4.1. 
The corpus for training is CUSENT, also developed in our laboratory.

Generally speaking, you may use the model for non-commercial, academic or personal use.

We also have other well-trained Cantonese acoustic models. 
If you would like to use the models and/or the CUSENT corpus for commercial 
applications or development, please contact Professor Tan LEE for appropriate license terms.

The character pronunciation comes from Jyutping phrase box from the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong.
