# Here is the list of phonemes and their class.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A phoneme/class definition is made as 3 columns:
# 	- first column is the key-word "PHONCLASS",
#	- second column is the phoneme,
#	- third column is the class-symbol.
#
# It is important to note that:
# 	- a vowel has to be mentioned with the class-symbol "V"
#	- the class-symbol to represent a break is "#"
#	- the letter "X" cannot be a class-symbol.

# list of vowels, use V symbol

# Here is the list of rules
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The rules are made as:
# 	- first column is a rule-type,
#	- second column is the classes between two vowels,
#	- third column is the boundary location.
# First column can be one of: GENRULE, EXCRULE, OTHRULE.
# In the third column, 0 means the boundary is after the first vowel,
# 1 means the boundary is one phoneme after the first vowel, etc.
#

# General rules contains only X between vowels
# Here, the use of class symbols is forbidden
# -------------
GENRULE VV 0
GENRULE VXV 0
GENRULE VXXV 1
GENRULE VXXXV 1
GENRULE VXXXXV 1
GENRULE VXXXXXV 2
GENRULE VXXXXXXV 3

#
# Exceptions rules contains only class symbols
# Here, the use of class symbols is required
# (except that X is forbidden)
# ----------------
# rule: VCGV -> V.CGV
EXCRULE VLGV 0
EXCRULE VPGV 0
EXCRULE VNGV 0
EXCRULE VFGV 0
EXCRULE VGGV 0

EXCRULE VPLV 0
EXCRULE VFLV 0

EXCRULE VPLGV 0
EXCRULE VFLGV 0
EXCRULE VPLPV 2

EXCRULE VLPPLV 2

#
# Specific rules are used to define which phoneme sequences must not be cut.
# Class symbols are forbidden, except V.
# ----------------
# Specific rules contains only phonemes or the symbol "ANY" which means
# "any phoneme". Classes are forbidden. It is made with 6 columns: first one is
# the key-word "OTHRULE", 4 following column are a phoneme sequence where the
# boundary of general or exception rule will cut at the third one, last column
# is the shift to apply to the boundary.
# For example, the line "OTHRULE ANY ANY p t 0" means that the boundary will
# be applied between the 'p' and 't' phoneme. Replacing 0 by -1 means the
# boundary will be between 'ANY' and 'p'.
# "petit", "peut-etre"
OTHRULE ANY ANY ANY p t -1
# "faisai[en]t"
OTHRULE ANY ANY V f s -1
# "parce que", "puisque", "pense que"
OTHRULE ANY ANY p s k -2
OTHRULE ANY p s k ANY -2
OTHRULE p s k ANY ANY 1
# "d[i]sonst"
OTHRULE ANY ANY V d z -1
