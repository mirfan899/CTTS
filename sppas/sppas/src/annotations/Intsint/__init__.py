INTSINT is an acronym for INternational Transcription System for INTonation.
It was originally developed by Daniel Hirst in his 1987 thesis as a
prosodic equivalent of the International Phonetic Alphabet, and the
INTSINT alphabet was subsequently used in Hirst & Di Cristo (eds) 1998
in just over half of the chapters.

INTSINT codes the intonation of an utterance by means of an alphabet of
8 discrete symbols constituting a surface phonological representation
of the intonation:

    T (Top),
    H (Higher),
    U (Upstepped),
    S (Same),
    M (mid),
    D (Downstepped),
    L (Lower),
    B (Bottom).

These tonal symbols are considered phonological in that they represent
discrete categories and surface since each tonal symbol corresponds to
a directly observable property of the speech signal.

INTSINT is computed from a set of selected F0 anchors. The implementation
into SPPAS corresponds to the most recent version of the algorithm:
