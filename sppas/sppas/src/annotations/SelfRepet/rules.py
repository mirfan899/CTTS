    Proposed rules deal with the number of words, the word frequencies and
    distinguishes if the repetition is strict or not. The following rules are
    proposed for other-repetitions:

        - Rule 1: A source is accepted if it contains one or more relevant
        token. Relevance depends on the speaker producing the echo;
        - Rule 2: A source which contains at least K tokens is accepted
        if the repetition is strict.

    Rule number 1 need to fix a clear definition of the relevance of a
    token. Un-relevant tokens are then stored in a stop-list.
    The stop-list also should contain very frequent tokens in the given
    language like adjectives, pronouns, etc.
