The syllabification of phonemes is performed with a rule-based system.
This RBS phoneme-to-syllable segmentation system is based on 2 main
principles:

    - a syllable contains a vowel, and only one.
    - a pause is a syllable boundary.

These two principles focus the problem of the task of finding a syllabic
boundary between two vowels.
As in state-of-the-art systems, phonemes were grouped into classes and
rules established to deal with these classes.
