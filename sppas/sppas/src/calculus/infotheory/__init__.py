    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Information Theory is a scientific fields that started with the Claude
Shannon's 1948 paper: *“A Mathematical  Theory  of  Communication”*
published in the Bell Systems Technical Journal.
There are several major concepts in this paper, including:

1. every communication channel has a speed limit, measured in binary
digits per second,
2. the architecture and design of communication systems,
3. source coding, i.e. the efficiency of the data representation
(remove redundancy in the information to make the message smaller)
